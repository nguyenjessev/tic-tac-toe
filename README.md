# Tic-Tac-Toe
Command-line version of tic-tac-toe, playable by two players

## Problems
Create a tic-tac-toe game that prints the game board after every turn, accepts user input, and determines a winner

## What I used
Ruby classes, modules, public and private methods, accessor methods, loops

## What I learned
How to use OOP to split a program into multiple logical components, minimizing how much of a class is exposed by privatizing methods, create a game loop, sanitize and validate user input
